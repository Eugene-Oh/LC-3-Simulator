# LC-3-Simulator
The program will simulate the LC-3 program. There are different methods that simulate different LC-3 operations such as AND, NOT, ADD, and LD.
To run the program, please run the simulator program, as it will display all of the different registers, memory locations, etc.
The simulator will specifically run a program that will display numbers 1-9 to the console.
